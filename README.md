This card game is a simple game of War with 3 rounds. There is no player input - the top card is simply drawn from the deck for each character, and the card values are compared each round to see who won that round. Finally, the total wins of each player are compared to determine the overall winner.
The card deck utilizes the Linked List.
The game is fully text-based and does not include player input, so you simply run the code to play.
